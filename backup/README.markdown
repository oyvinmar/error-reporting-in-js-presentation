# Error reporting in JavaScript presentation

A presentation on error reporting in JavaScript using [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/) (A React.js based library for creating sleek presentations using JSX syntax)


## Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `yarn`. (or `npm install` if you're about that life)

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
